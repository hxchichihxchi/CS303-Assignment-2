# CS303 Assignment 2
## Running the Program
1) Download and open the code in an IDE.
2) Follow the prompts as directed. The program will close after the user goes through all of the prompts and procedures.

## Menu Navigation
When running the program, it prompts the user to start either the "Linked List" activity by entering "1". or the "Integer Stack" activity by entering "2". Upon entering one of the valid inputs, the corresponding activity will run. If the user were to input anything else, the program will close.

## Linked List Activity
If the user were to select this activity, the program will create and display a linked list with four randomly generated integers between 0-100 inclusive. Then the program will also display the front and back of the linked list.

Then the program will prompt the user to input an index value to add an element at that value.
If the user inputs a number that is either less than 0 or greater than 5, the program will output that the input is not valid and automatically changes the input to either 0 or 4 then proceeds from there.

The program then prompts the user to input an integer value to insert at the inputted index value. After a valid input the program will then output the new linked list with the added element.

The program will next prompt the user to enter an index value to remove its element from the list.
Upon removal, the program will output the new linked list, pop the front and back elements and display the final linked list. The program will verify that the list is not empty and will close.

## Integer Stack Activity
If the user were to select this activity, the program will create a stack object and verifies that the stack is empty. Then the program will generate three random integers between 0-100 that would then be pushed into the stack. The program will then check the stack again and states that the stack object is no longer empty. Following this, the program prompts the user to enter how many more elements they wish to add towards the stack.

Upon inputting a valid integer, the program will then print out the new stack with the newly added integers.

With the new stack, the program will state and perform the following actions automatically:
- Shows the top/most recently added element into the stack.
- Removes the top element from the stack.
- Shows the new modified stack.
- Shows the new top element from the stack.
- Calculates and displays the average of all elements in the stack.
- Closes the program
